User story in Azure DevOps, complete with Git traceability

Create a Work Item (User Story):
Start by creating a work item (user story) in Azure DevOps. This represents the feature or functionality you want to implement.
Provide a clear description, acceptance criteria, and any other relevant details.

Branch Creation:
From the work item, create a new Git branch. This branch will be where you develop the changes related to this user story.
Naming conventions for branches can follow a pattern like userstory123-feature-name.

Development:
Developers work on the branch, making code changes related to the user story.
Regularly commit changes to the branch.

Pull Request (PR):
Once the code changes are complete, create a pull request (PR) from the user story branch to the main branch (or any other target branch).
The PR serves as a review mechanism, allowing other team members to provide feedback and ensure code quality.

Linking Work Items and Commits:
As part of the PR process, link the work item (user story) to the commits in the PR.
This establishes traceability between the code changes and the original requirement.

Code Review and Approval:
Reviewers examine the changes in the PR.
If everything looks good, approve the PR.

Merge and Build:
Merge the PR into the main branch.
Azure DevOps triggers a build pipeline automatically.
The build process compiles, tests, and packages the code.

Release and Deployment:
Set up release pipelines in Azure DevOps.
Define stages (e.g., Dev, QA, Production) and deploy the code to each environment.
Link the release to the original work item.

Testing and Validation:
Run tests (manual or automated) against the deployed application.
Validate that the user storyâ€™s functionality works as expected.

Estimation and Closure:
Throughout the process, track time spent on the user story.
Compare the actual effort with the initial estimation.
Close the work item when the user story is fully implemented, tested, and deployed.

Traceability:
Azure DevOps provides end-to-end traceability by linking work items, branches, commits, builds, and releases.
You can monitor this traceability using built-in reports and Analytics
